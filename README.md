Adventura Pvt. Limited -
Customer Segmentation and Sales Performance Analysis

Introduction
This project analyzes Adventura Pvt. Limited's historical sales and customer data to identify key customer segments, evaluate marketing campaign effectiveness, and provide actionable recommendations to increase revenue and optimize future marketing spend. The primary goal was to shift away from broad marketing efforts to a data-driven, targeted approach.

Data Source

Source data was a proprietary sales database containing tables: Sales, Transactions, Customer Demographics, Product categories and Subcategories, Return Data etc.
The dataset covered sales from January 2020 to June 2022.

Tools, Technologies, Analysis & Visualization

Power BI (primary tool)
Advanced Calculations: DAX (for measures to be used for analysis)
Documentation: Microsoft Word for Markdown

Data Preparation

Performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to merge more than 5 tables into a cohesive star schema model in Power BI. Key transformations included: Handling nulls in the Customer Occupation field, standardizing date formats, and creating a calendar table for time-intelligence analysis.
Created several complex DAX measures, including a time-intelligent Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth.
